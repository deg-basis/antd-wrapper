# `crux`/`example`

A simple demo of `crux` components used in a webapp.

## Note on the `IconWithTooltipExample` and `UploadExample` components

These components are not exported by `crux` yet. Their examples have therefore been commented out in the demo.
Once these are exported by `crux`, they may be un-commented. (And updated if the components have changed.)

## Requirements

- `crux`: follow the instructions in the crux Readme to get access
- Node modules: run `yarn install`

## Running the project

Run `yarn start`.

The demo should become available at `localhost:3000` in your browser.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

A quick overview of the available scripts from CRA:

- **`yarn start`:** Runs the app in the development mode, available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits, and any linter errors will be shown in the console.
- **`yarn test`:** Runs any tests that have been added, in interactive watch mode.
- **`yarn build`:** Builds the app for production, to the `build` folder, minimized and optimized for performance.
- **`yarn eject`:** "Ejects" the app from create-react-app's infrastructure. This enables freer customization
